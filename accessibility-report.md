For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:

(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or

(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.

 Principle 1: Equitable Use
 
With the basic pre-requisite of basic computer literacy and knowledge of basic English, this program is accessible 
to those of all ages. For instance, the interface to write a review can be used by adults but is basic enough for
a 8-year old child to understand (fill in the fields and click submit)/

Principle 2: Flexibility of Use

A basic feature that could improve the flexibility of this program would be to implement a dark mode option. This would
be useful during nighttime hours or for people who simply prefer the dark mode aesthetic.

Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use

To ensure that this program remains simple and intuitive, we help prompt the user when necessary. For instance, when 
writing a review, the user is asked to "choose a rating" followed by a dropdown menu with several choices. This ensures
a new user to the program would quickly understand how to use the program.

Principle 4: Perceptible Information

A feature we could add would be a voiceover that reads reviews aloud to the user. This feature would help users with
some visual impairments (but not complete blindness) utilize this application.

Principle 5: Tolerance for Error

This principle does not apply for this program due to it's design. A user cannot select an invalid rating as their
choices are limited by the program. Additionally, a user cannot select a movie that does not exist to review since
they are forced to select movies that do exist.

Principle 6: Low Physical Effort

This principle does not apply to the design of this software. Apps inherently do not require significantly physical 
extertion, only requiring minimial motor skills (use of mouse or keyboard).

Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use

A useful feature that could be added to our program to fit this principle would be different text size options. This
would help users who find the default text too small to read or want smaller text to fit more information on a single 
page.

Target Audience for IMDBRipOff

Overall, while this app is applicable to the general public, the target audience is for movie enthuasists. People within
this category are interested in watching movies, but more importantly, they desire to share their thoughts on such movies.
This application would be a great opportunity for people to recommend stellar movies to others, while also criticizing
underwhelming movies. Additionally, individuals who are looking to try out a new genre 
can get community recommendations on what to watch first. In short, this application is designed for movie enthuasists
but is useful for the general public as well.
